Description

1. This code uses sequential circuit one catch one by cout.  
2. ALU control [0][1] decides the behavior of the operator(add or and slt)  
3. ALU control [2][3] decides if input should be inverted or not.  
4. SUB=A+(~B)  NOR=(~A)AND(~B)  NAND=(~A)OR(~B)  
5. The last bits decide overflow.
